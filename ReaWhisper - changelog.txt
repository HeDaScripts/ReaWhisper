## v0.1.0 (2024-05-17)
  + Basic script to run OpenAI Whisper from REAPER.
	Simple version with manual options from settings.lua.txt file.
	It launches whisper command to transcribe the audio of a selected item
	into a srt file, and then import the srt into a track in REAPER. 
	The track is the next track of the item's track. so you may want to create
